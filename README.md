## About the Project
<ins>Air Quality Data (Tableau)</ins> 

___Context:___\
Since industrialization, there has been an increasing concern about environmental pollution. As mentioned in the WHO report 7 million premature deaths annually are linked to air pollution, air pollution is the world's largest single environmental risk. Moreover as reported in the NY Times article, India’s Air Pollution Rivals China’s as World’s Deadliest it has been found that India's air pollution is deadlier than China's.</br>You can explore India’s air pollution levels more granularly using this dataset.

___Content:___\
This data is combined(across the years and states) and is largely a clean version of the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP).\
Building a Tableau Dashboard for the India Air Pollution dataset involves several steps. Below are the key components and steps that you can follow: Can we relate the air quality changes to changes in Environmental policy in India?
